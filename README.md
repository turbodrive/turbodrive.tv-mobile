Turbodrive Mobile
=================

Mobile (smartphone) version of my personal website / portfolio.

Turbodrive is an interactive experience. It has been designed for a 1024px layout minimum and need to have inline video (for overlaying info on it). This is the fallback version of the website for small screen devices.
Built to work on Android and iOS browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Android browser).

Actual version of Turbodrive works on HTML5 browsers for tablets and desktop, with fallback to the former flash version. Repo available here : <a href="https://github.com/turbodrive/turbodrive.tv">https://github.com/turbodrive/turbodrive.tv</a>
